      "If you are not a programmer, Python is a language designed for you. Here is what Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, wrote in his funding submission to DARPA, titled [Computer Programming for Everybody](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/cp4e/) back in 1999. The whole text makes for a beautiful cofee reading.\n",

The result is that today Python has the most vibrant developer community of all languages, and that is translated into good libraries and expertise.\n",

      "Another popular source describing Python is the [Zen of Python](http://www.thezenofpython.com/), a collection of 20 aphorisms similar in style to a taoist book, most of whom are adressed towards programers but some are easy to understand by anyone:\n",

      "**A short history**\n",
      "\n",
      "The first programming languages had a concise syntax and were able to control the computer at a very low level. The best surviving dino from that era is probably C, a language that allows you to directly control the memory registry that the processor is using. In time as software accumulated and the IT infrastructure evolved languages became specialized, whith languages like C++ and Java controlling the commercial sector and Matlab, R and others being employed in engineering, statistics respectively. Meanwhile, languages became more distant to the hardware, becoming interpreted by a an engine that lies between the operating system and the program itself. Languages that are ready to run the moment writing stops are commonly called scripting languages. Another important changed occured in the manner data structures are managed, some languages alowing the type of an object to be verified and changed during runtime. These are called dynamic languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rise of the scripting languages.** It is difficult to explain why scripting languages became so ubiquitous. It has to do with the lack of time and with safety. In C it is relatively easy to make mistakes that can damage a hardware, it takes more time to do something if you are not skilled and you write ugly code if you are not talented. The general purpose languages that stood out were Perl and Python. However, Perl came first and had an intently obfuscated syntax this is because it was primarily adressed to programmers. Many sequencing libraries were developed into or integrated Perl. R also developed as an opensource alternative to SAS, a language used in statistics. When Python started Perl dominated text processing, R dominated open source computing and Javascript dominated the web. But Python was adressed to everyone, and in a decade became the number one scripting language in terms of popularity. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Future** I am not trying to speculate, the point of Python was made, today older languages are trying to copy Python features, while new languages develop that are grown from Python concepts and will ultimately compete for broad audiences. I myself programmed in 30 different languages or more and I kept my sanity so there is no reason for alarm. Python is probably the best introduction to programming at this moment in time.\n"

      "\n",
      "As a data scientist working in biology, or as a biologist working with data science, calling Python at a party brings with it a few friends, which I recommend you get to know in time, or maybe some of them are already familiar? The mistake of the beginer is to think he knows programming after a three day course. The following list should not discourage you, in three days you will already be able to do what programmers spend most of their time with, and maybe free some of them for more important work.\n",
      "\n",
      "- R. It is hard to extract your data if you avoid R. Many Python fans complain of R's byzantine syntax, or quote what R experts say, that R is a plaftorm with a language instead of the opposite. This is all true of course, but keep in mind that R just like Python has the real programming done in C. Much of the bioinformatics toolset is in R and Python is the perfect glue for R calls, managing data and making research.\n",
      "\n",
      "- C. No matter how good computers become, core stuff will always need to run fast and not hog on resources. C is the mother of most software including the interpterers for most programming languages. The best Python libraries for scientific computing for example are mere calls to compiled C code. C is not as hard as it used to be. Notably Cython is a way to call C and C++ to and from Python. Swig is another language agnosting platform with makes it easy to design bindings for C code.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Perl. Perl is viewed as a dying language since the community migrated to Python but there is a lot of bioinformatics code writen in Perl. Some still think that text processing is the best, and Perl is slightly more geekish and more natively integrated with the Unix toolset. It fits you better than Python if you hate the mainstream.\n",
      "\n",
      "- HPC. High performance computing is all the rage today and Python is struggling to keep up with younger languages that were designed with cloud computing, server farms and super clusters in mind. Have a go with some of the new kids on the block, such as GO, Scala, Julia, etc. However Python implements the latest methodologies for distributed computing, such as MapReduce and has decent multiprocessing libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Java, C++, C#. Together these languages contain a lot of bioinformatics software. Most NGS sequencing programs and most data science programs are written in Java. Through Jython one can integrate Java classes with Python modules. Python claims it too but Java is probably the only platforms that can trully claim to come with \"baterries included\", since most of Python batteries are in C. C++ is originally an object oriented extension of C and Python can treat it with the same tools and C# is what Microsoft did when it felt that too many programers are abandoning Visual C++ for Java. The Microsoft clone of Python is called IronPython, in case you wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Matlab. Most of the scientific computing software in Python is an open source version of Matlab libraries. Yes, Matlab is that good, if you can afford it. Matlab is still setting the trend in the field. For the poor, Octave is a free and open source alternative. SageMath is another popular collection of opensource libraries that includes most of Python scientific computing libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Javascript. While Python dominates the multipurpose scripting languages, one scripting languages dominates the browsers and slowly makes its way into server-side scripting too. Javascript much like R is viewed with disgust by many programmers due to its semantic imperfections but a recent statistics claims that 70% of the world code is running on Javascript interpreter. I wrote this entire course in the browser using IPython without ever using a Python editor, and the only community that is as vibrant as Python's is probably the HTML5 community, that embraces the latest open web standards. Some claim operating systems are superfluous, and ChromeOS is certainly there to prove it. In terms of data visualization and interactivity, .js does not have equal. It is a bit too fictional to imagine that .js will improve to defeat all languages, more likely it is that assemblers will make the entire question of languages irrelevant and people will use what comes handier.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Linux. It is probably more suitable that I write open source and open hardware, but unfortunately Linux is the only OS that qualifies. Linux runs the most popular mobile OS (Android) and is native to the most popular PC gaming and home entertainment platform (Steam + SteamOS). Free and open source software such as Python, R, C, Java and Perl feels best with Linux. The same can be said about open hardware. The revolution Python created by lowering the bar in programming is currently undergoing in hardware. From RapsberyPi minicomputers to Arduino microcontrollers, architecture is opening up to the common people, and Python/Linux is their main development environment. It will not be long until researchers will sit at three day courses on how to assemble sequencers, PCR machines and mass-spec chambers from multipurpose parts. I am on Linux and I am happy. I do not push it on you, I am not forcing it on my kids. It feels great to be able to use all the open software at the home of open software, that is all. My laptop is happier too and so are my servers.\n",

For the purpose of the course I am using a core set of the most common libraries. But for presentation purposes I am also using libraries that may be hard to install on certain situations.

Similarly old programs will not work on new operating systems, thus one can install virtualization programs line VirtualBox, that allow you to run for example ancient version of Windows, Linux and Mac OS all from the same OS.
